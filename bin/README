|SETUP|
+-----+

The bin directory contains some scripts for developing and/or administering
OpenFISMA. In order to use these scripts, you will probably need to setup a few
items.

1) You may want to add the bin directory to your path. Add the following to your
.profile or similar .rc file.

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/openfisma/bin

2) The Perl scripts rely on the fisma.pm Perl module to be present in the library
path, so you will probably want to add the bin directory to your Perl library
path.

export PERL5LIB=/path/to/openfisma/bin

3) Modify configuration files. Each script relies on a configuration file which
is also generally included in the bin directory. These files all have a common
suffix (.cfg) and a common format. The format is very simple, using a key/value
format that should be very self-explanatory. The default configuration files
should provide enough comments that the meaning of each configuration item is
clear.

|SCRIPTS|
+-------+

This section details the scripts available here and what they do.

1) anonymize.pl

Anonymize.pl randomizes data in an OpenFISMA schema according to hardcoded rules
within the script. This would be useful if you were reporting a bug and wanted
to provide a screenshot or schema dump file without disclosing any sensitive
information.

The anonymize.pl script maintains the relational structure of the original schema,
but replaces numeric and text fields with random characters.

2) backup.pl

Backup.pl backs up all of the schema data, evidence files, and application source
code, then tars and gzips the backup. It is configurable to keep backup files for
a certain period of time before purging expired backup files.

It is recommended to run this script as a cron job during off peak hours. It is
*not* transaction safe, so at the very least all users must be logged off before
it starts.

You might wonder if backup.pl has a corresponding script named "restore.pl"...
the answer is, "not yet". Currently the only way to restore from backup is manually.

3) expireAccounts.pl

This POSIX-only script (not Windows compatible) is used to expire inactive OS
accounts. This script allows OpenFISMA instances to implement the security
control AC-2(3) specified in NIST SP 800-53.

If you are running a major application for a US federal agency, then you will
probably need to implement this security control. Create a cron job to execute
this script every night and it will deactivate any accounts which have been
inactive for longer than the maximum period (which is configurable).

4) migrate.pl, testmigrate.pl, schemadump.pl

These scripts are used in conjunction with the OpenFISMA migrations. See
http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgznrgjw_15f7wt6cg3 for more information about
how these tools work.
