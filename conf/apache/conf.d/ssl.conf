# Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG):
# Configure one or more sources to seed the PRNG of the 
# SSL library. The seed data should be of good random quality.
# WARNING! On some platforms /dev/random blocks if not enough entropy
# is available. This means you then cannot use the /dev/random device
# because it would lead to very long connection times (as long as
# it requires to make more entropy available). But usually those
# platforms additionally provide a /dev/urandom device which doesn't
# block. So, if available, use this one instead. Read the mod_ssl User
# Manual for more details.

# This directive can be used to control the SSL protocol flavors mod_ssl 
# should use when establishing its server environment. Clients then can 
# only connect with one of the provided protocols.

# List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.

##
# Server Certificate:
# Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
# the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
# pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again. A test
# certificate can be generated with `make certificate' under
# built time. Keep in mind that if you've both a RSA and a DSA
# certificate you can configure both in parallel (to also allow
# the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)

##
# Server Private Key:
# If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
# directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
# you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
# both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
