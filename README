Overview
============================================================================
The OpenFISMA project is an open source application designed to reduce the 
complexity and automate the regulatory requirements of the Federal Information 
Security Management Act (FISMA) and the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF). While many security managers 
are eager to demonstrate their best practices for incident response, patch 
management, and configuration management, they are overwhelmed with the 
reporting and documentation requirements of FISMA. You can download our 
released software right away or peruse the current documentation.

OpenFISMA is built on the Zend Framework which is an open source, object 
oriented, web application framework with a flexible architecture. ZF is 
often referred to as a 'component library' because it has many loosely 
coupled components that you can use more or less independently. However, 
Zend Framework also provides a core model-view-controller (MVC) 
implementation that you can use to provide basic 'best practices' 
structure to web applications.

6.0 Directory Layout
============================================================================
application/ - This directory is the meat and bones of OpenFISMA. It houses
the MVC system, as well as conifgurations, api's used, and the bootstrap 
file. 

application/apis/ - This directory is for application specific web-service api 
files that are consumed and/or provided by your application (through a controller 
presumabely). 

application/config/ - The application wide configuration directory 

application/controllers/ - Default controller directory

application/models/ - Default models directory

application/views/ - Default views directory

application/views/helpers - TODO fill in description
application/views/filters - TODO fill in description
application/views/scripts - TODO fill in description

application/layouts -  - This layout directory is for MCV based layouts. 
Since Zend_Layout is capable of MVC and non-mvc layouts, this location 
choice for this directory signifies that layouts are not on a 1-to-1 
relationship with controllers and are independent of templates within views/. 

application/layouts/filters - TODO fill in description
application/layouts/helpers - TODO fill in description
application/layouts/scripts - TODO fill in description

application/controllers/helpers/ - These directories will contain action 
helpers. Action helpers will be namespaced either as "Controller_Helper_" 
for the default module or "<Module>Controller_Helper" in other modules. 

application/modules/ - The idea of modules allows a developer to group a set of 
related controllers (that might be growing to be too large for any one controller 
repository) into a logically orgainized group. The sub structure of the modules 
directory would mimic the entire structure of the application directory minus the 
bootstrap.php file.

application/bootstrap.php - This file represents the entry point into your
application. This first could be procedural php or could contain a Bootstrap class. 
Either way, the purpose for this file is to bootstrap the application – not 
PHP settings – and make components aware of their comsumption by starting 
or configuring them. This file would not call dispatch() on the front controller. 

data/ - The goal of this directory is to provide a place to store application 
data that is volatile and rumtime. The interruption of some data inside this 
directory might cause the application to fail on any one request. Also, the 
information in this directory may or may not make its way from/into a 
subversion repository. Examples of things contained in this directory 
are session files, cache files, sqlite databases, logs and indexes to name a few. 

data/cache - TODO fill in description

data/sessions - TODO fill in description

data/uploads - TODO fill in description

data/uploads/evidence - TODO fill in description

data/uploads/scanreports - TODO fill in description

data/logs - TODO fill in description

data/indexes - TODO fill in description

docs/ - This directory exists for documentation, either generated (think PHPDoc) 
or hand written 

library/ - This directory houses the library/Zend/* folder which is the Zend 
Framework. In theory, you could also use other include_path-able not named Zend/* 
in here 

scripts/ - This directory is intended for maintenance, and/or build scripts. 
Typically, these might include command line, cron, or phing build scripts that 
are executed independently of the web application itself. 

scripts/cronjobs - Scripts that need to be run from cron.

scripts/bin - Collection of scripts used to facilitate maintenance of the application,
which are usually run in an interactive fashion from the command line.

temp/ - The temp folder (typically set in php.ini as /tmp on unix), is set aside 
for non- or semi- volatile application data. Roughly speaking, the contents of temp 
would typically be generated by an application and used during its lifetime of requests. 
This information (typically), would not be seen inside the applications svn repository. 
Also, it should be noted that usually, if temp/ were cleared out, the application should 
be able to continue running without much of a hiccup. 

tests/ - This directory serves as a purpose for containing application tests. These 
could be hand written, phpunit tests, selenium based tests or (insert your testing 
framework here). By default, library code could be tested my mimicing the directory 
structure of your library/ directory. Additionally, functional tests for your 
application could be written mimicing the application/ directory structure (including 
the application subdirectory). This directory would contain a PHPUnit configuration 
file to assure all functional tests would work correctly. 

public/ - This directory would contain all public files for your application, including 
index.php. index.php would setup the PHP environment, include the bootstrap.php file 
from your application/ directory, and finally dispatch() the front controller.

public/images - TODO fill in description
public/stylesheets - TODO fill in description
public/javascripts - TODO fill in description
public/flash - TODO fill in description
public/evidence - TODO move all evidence to data/uploads directory
public/temp - TODO move all temp data to data/temp directory
