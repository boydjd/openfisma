                <h4> OpenFISMA Introduction </h4>
                OpenFISMA is an open source application designed to reduce the complexity
                and automate the regulatory requirements of the Federal Information
                Security Management Act (FISMA) and the National Institute of Science
                and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF). While many
                security managers are eager to demonstrate their best practices for
                incident response, patch management, and configuration management,
                they are overwhelmed with the reporting and documentation requirements
                of FISMA. Below is a brief listing of some of the documents that
                OpenFISMA automates:
