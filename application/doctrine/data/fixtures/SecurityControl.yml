        supplementalGuidance: >
            Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, ruled-based policies) and 
            associated access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, 
            cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf 
            of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information 
            system. In addition to controlling access at the information system level, access enforcement mechanisms 
            are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the 
            organization. If encryption of stored information is employed as an access enforcement mechanism, the 
            cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 compliant.

            system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy.
        supplementalGuidance: >
            Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are employed by organizations to control the 
            flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., individuals, devices) within 
            information systems and between interconnected systems based on the characteristics of the information. 
            Simple examples of flow control enforcement can be found in firewall and router devices that employ rule 
            sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services or provide a packet 
            filtering capability. Flow control enforcement can also be found in information systems that use explicit 
            labels on information, source, and destination objects as the basis for flow control decisions (e.g., to 
            control the release of certain types of information).

            Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, rule-based policies) and 
            associated access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, 
            cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf 
            of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information 
            system. In addition to controlling access at the information system level, access enforcement mechanisms 
            are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the 
            organization. Consideration is given to the implementation of a controlled, audited, and manual override of 
            automated mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored

            system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy.
        supplementalGuidance: >
            Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and 
            between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit 
            regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A few, of many, generalized examples of possible 
            restrictions that are better expressed as flow control than access control are: keeping export controlled 
            information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be 
            from within the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the 
            internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by 
            organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., 
            networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control 
            is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific examples of flow 
            control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, guards, encrypted 
            tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict 
            information system services or provide a packet filtering capability. Related security control: SC-7.

            system-related activities and periodically reviews changes to access authorizations. The organization 
            reviews more frequently the activities of users with significant information system roles and 
            responsibilities. The extent of the audit record reviews is based on the FIPS 199 impact level of the 
            information system. For example, for low-impact systems, it is not intended that security logs be reviewed 
            frequently for every workstation, but rather at central points such as a web proxy or email servers and 
            when specific circumstances warrant review of other audit records. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides

            Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) 
            communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of 
            remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Remote access controls are applicable to 
            information systems other than public web servers or systems specifically designed for public access. The 
            organization restricts access achieved through dial-up connections (e.g., limiting dial-up access based 
            upon source of request) or protects against unauthorized connections or subversion of authorized 
            connections (e.g., using virtual private network technology). NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides

            in support of the security accreditation. Security assessments conducted in support of security 
            accreditations are called security certifications. The security accreditation of an information system is 
            not a static process. Through the employment of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process (the fourth 
            and final phase of the certification and accreditation process), the critical information contained in the

            information system owner with an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system. To

            are volatile or critical to protecting the information system are assessed at least annually. All other 
            controls are assessed at least once during the information system's three-year accreditation cycle. The

            Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the 
            functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational 
            operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple 
            services from a single component of an information system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the 
            services provided by any one component. Where feasible, the organization limits component functionality 
            to a single function per device (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and services 
            provided by information systems, or individual components of information systems, are carefully reviewed 
            to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet

            electronic authentication including strength of authentication mechanisms. For purposes of this control, 
            the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-63 is applied to both local and remote access to 
            information systems. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an

            directly to a device without the use of a network. Unless a more stringent control enhancement is 
            specified, authentication for both local and remote information system access is NIST Special Publication 
            800-63 level 1 compliant. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal

            Sanitization is the process used to remove information from information system media such that there is 
            reasonable assurance, in proportion to the confidentiality of the information, that the information cannot 
            be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, and destroying media 
            information, prevent the disclosure of organizational information to unauthorized individuals when such 
            media is reused or disposed. The organization uses its discretion on sanitization techniques and procedures 
            for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to 
            have no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if released for reuse or disposed. NIST Special 
            Publication 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. The National Security Agency also provides 
            media sanitization guidance and maintains a listing of approved sanitization products at

            assets, or individuals based on the operation of the information system. The organization also considers 
            potential impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security 
            Presidential Directives, potential national-level impacts in categorizing the information system. Risk 
            assessments also take into account risk posed to organizational operations, organizational assets, or 
            individuals from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on 
            behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing

            </ol>
        supplementalGuidance: >
            An external information system service is a service that is implemented outside of the accreditation 
            boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that is used by, but not a part of, 
            the organizational information system). Relationships with external service providers are established in 
            a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements 
            (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, 
            and/or supply chain exchanges. Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the 
            organization's operations and assets, and to individuals, arising from the use of external information 
            system services remains with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an 
            appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many 
            issues associated with information system security. For services external to the organization, a chain 
            of trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each 
            participating service provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides 
            adequate protection for the services rendered to the organization. Where a sufficient level of trust 
            cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs 
            compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or 
            to individuals. The external information system services documentation includes government, service 
            provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. 
            Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required security control, 
            describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for any identified 
            instance of non-compliance. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides guidance on information technology 
            security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on the security considerations in

        supplementalGuidance: >
            A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides name/address 
            resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there are typically 
            at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as 
            secondary. Additionally, the two servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and 
            geographically separated (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). If organizational 
            information technology resources are divided into those resources belonging to internal networks and 
            those resources belonging to external networks, authoritative DNS servers with two roles (internal and 
            external) are established. The DNS server with the internal role provides name/address resolution 
            information pertaining to both internal and external information technology resources while the DNS 
            server with the external role only provides name/address resolution information pertaining to external 
            information technology resources. The list of clients who can access the authoritative DNS server of a 
            particular role is also specified. NIST Special Publication 800-81 provides guidance on secure DNS

            The organization employs malicious code protection mechanisms at critical information system entry and 
            exit points (e.g., firewalls, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers) 
            and at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices on the network. The organization uses the 
            malicious code protection mechanisms to detect and eradicate malicious code (e.g., viruses, worms, 
            Trojan horses, spyware) transported:
            <ol>

            attacks, and provide identification of unauthorized use of the system.
        supplementalGuidance: >
            Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques 
            (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, 
            audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Monitoring devices are strategically 
            deployed within the information system (e.g., at selected perimeter locations, near server farms 
            supporting critical applications) to collect essential information. Monitoring devices are also deployed 
            at ad hoc locations within the system to track specific transactions. Additionally, these devices are 
            used to track the impact of security changes to the information system. The granularity of the 
            information collected is determined by the organization based upon its monitoring objectives and the 
            capability of the information system to support such activities. Organizations consult appropriate legal 
            counsel with regard to all information system monitoring activities. Organizations heighten the level of 
            information system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of increased risk to 
            organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals based on law enforcement information, 
            intelligence information, or other credible sources of information. NIST Special Publication 800-61 
            provides guidance on detecting attacks through various types of security technologies. NIST Special

            Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, rule-based policies) and 
            associated access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, 
            cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf 
            of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information 
            system. In addition to controlling access at the information system level, access enforcement mechanisms 
            are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the 
            organization. Consideration is given to the implementation of a controlled, audited, and manual override of 
            automated mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored 
            information is employed as an access enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as 
            amended) compliant. Related security control: SC-13.

            The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the 
            system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy.
        supplementalGuidance: >
            Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and 
            between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit 
            regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A few, of many, generalized examples of possible 
            restrictions that are better expressed as flow control than access control are: keeping export controlled 
            information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be 
            from within the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the 
            internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by 
            organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., 
            networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control 
            is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific examples of flow 
            control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, guards, encrypted 
            tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict 
            information system services or provide a packet filtering capability. Related security control: SC-7.

            The purpose of this control is to identify important events which need to be audited as significant and 
            relevant to the security of the information system. The organization specifies which information system 
            components carry out auditing activities. Auditing activity can affect information system performance. 
            Therefore, the organization decides, based upon a risk assessment, which events require auditing on a 
            continuous basis and which events require auditing in response to specific situations. Audit records can be 
            generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverse the 
            network. Selecting the right level of abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an 
            audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Additionally, the 
            security audit function is coordinated with the network health and status monitoring function to enhance 
            the mutual support between the two functions by the selection of information to be recorded by each 
            function. The checklists and configuration guides at http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html provide recommended

            accreditations are called security certifications. The security accreditation of an information system is 
            not a static process. Through the employment of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process (the fourth 
            and final phase of the certification and accreditation process), the critical information contained in the 
            accreditation package (i.e., the system security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of 
            action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis providing the authorizing official and the 
            information system owner with an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system. To 
            reduce the administrative burden of the three-year reaccreditation process, the authorizing official uses 
            the results of the ongoing continuous monitoring process to the maximum extent possible as the basis for 
            rendering a reaccreditation decision. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the security 
            certification and accreditation of information systems. Related security controls: CA-2, CA-4, CA-7.

            <p>Continuous monitoring activities include configuration management and control of information system 
            components, security impact analyses of changes to the system, ongoing assessment of security controls, and 
            status reporting. The organization assesses all security controls in an information system during the 
            initial security accreditation. Subsequent to the initial accreditation and in accordance with OMB policy, 
            the organization assesses a subset of the controls annually during continuous monitoring. The selection of 
            an appropriate subset of security controls is based on: <ol><li>the FIPS 199 security categorization of the 
            information system;</li><li>the specific security controls selected and employed by the organization to 
            protect the information system; and</li><li>the level of assurance (or grounds for confidence) that the 
            organization must have in determining the effectiveness of the security controls in the information system. 
            </li></ol> The organization establishes the selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the 
            security controls employed within the information system for assessment. The organization also establishes 
            the schedule for control monitoring to ensure adequate coverage is achieved. Those security controls that 
            are volatile or critical to protecting the information system are assessed at least annually. All other 
            controls are assessed at least once during the information system's three-year accreditation cycle. The 
            organization can use the current year's assessment results obtained during continuous monitoring to meet 
            the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-2).</p>
            <p>This control is closely related to and mutually supportive of the activities required in monitoring 
            configuration changes to the information system. An effective continuous monitoring program results in 
            ongoing updates to the information system security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of 
            action and milestones--the three principle documents in the security accreditation package. A rigorous and 
            well executed continuous monitoring process significantly reduces the level of effort required for the 
            reaccreditation of the information system. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the 
            continuous monitoring process. NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the assessment of 
            security controls. Related security controls: CA-2, CA-4, CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.</p>

            <p>Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly 
            identified and documented by the organization in accordance security control AC-14. Authentication of user 
            identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor 
            authentication, some combination thereof. NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote 
            electronic authentication including strength of authentication mechanisms. For purposes of this control, 
            the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-63 is applied to both local and remote access to 
            information systems. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an 
            information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the 
            Internet). Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information 
            system) communicating through an internal organization-controlled network (e.g., local area network) or 
            directly to a device without the use of a network. Unless a more stringent control enhancement is 
            specified, authentication for both local and remote information system access is NIST Special Publication 
            800-63 level 1 compliant. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal 
            identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique identification and authentication of federal 
            employees and contractors. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system 
            level (i.e., at system logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application 
            level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.</p>
            <p>In accordance with OMB policy and E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of public 
            users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related 
            information. The e-authentication risk assessment conducted in accordance with OMB Memorandum 04-04 is used 
            in determining the NIST Special Publication 800-63 compliance requirements for such accesses with regard to 
            the IA-2 control and its enhancements. Scalability, practicality, and security issues are simultaneously 
            considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for public access to such information and 
            information systems with the need to protect organizational operations, organizational assets, and

            An external information system service is a service that is implemented outside of the accreditation 
            boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that is used by, but not a part of, 
            the organizational information system). Relationships with external service providers are established in 
            a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements 
            (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, 
            and/or supply chain exchanges. Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the 
            organization's operations and assets, and to individuals, arising from the use of external information 
            system services remains with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an 
            appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many 
            issues associated with information system security. For services external to the organization, a chain 
            of trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each 
            participating service provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides 
            adequate protection for the services rendered to the organization. Where a sufficient level of trust 
            cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs 
            compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or to 
            individuals. The external information system services documentation includes government, service 
            provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. 
            Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required security control, 
            describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for any identified 
            instance of non-compliance. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides guidance on information technology

            A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides name/address 
            resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there are typically 
            at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as 
            secondary. Additionally, the two servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and 
            geographically separated (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). If organizational information 
            technology resources are divided into those resources belonging to internal networks and those resources 
            belonging to external networks, authoritative DNS servers with two roles (internal and external) are 
            established. The DNS server with the internal role provides name/address resolution information

        supplementalGuidance: >
            Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and 
            access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) are 
            employed by organizations to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and 
            objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system. In 
            addition to enforcing authorized access at the information-system level, access enforcement mechanisms are 
            employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the 
            organization. Consideration is given to the implementation of an audited, explicit override of automated 
            mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored information is 
            employed as an access enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant. 
            For classified information, the cryptography used is largely dependent on the classification level of the 
            information and the clearances of the individuals having access to the information. Mechanisms implemented 
            by AC-3 are configured to enforce authorizations determined by other security controls. Related controls:

        control: >
            The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the 
            system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy.
        supplementalGuidance: >
            Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and 
            between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit 
            regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A few examples of flow control restrictions include: 
            keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside 
            traffic that claims to be from within the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet 
            that are not from the internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are 
            commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and 
            destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected 
            systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. 
            Specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, 
            gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish 
            configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability 
            based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on content (e.g., using key word 
            searches or document characteristics). Mechanisms implemented by AC-4 are configured to enforce 
            authorizations determined by other security controls. Related controls: AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-7, SA-8,

            <ol>
            <li>Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after [<em>Assignment:

            authentication procedures.</li>
            </ol>
        supplementalGuidance: >
            A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate 
            physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of 
            the absence. The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. This is
            typically at the operating system-level, but may be at the application-level. A session lock is not a 
            substitute for logging out of the information system, for example, if the organization requires users to 
            log out at the end of the workday.

        supplementalGuidance: >
            This control is intended for those specific instances where an organization determines that no 
            identification and authentication is required; it is not, however, mandating that such instances exist in 
            given information system. The organization may allow a limited number of user actions without 
            identification and authentication (e.g., when individuals access public websites or other publicly 
            accessible federal information systems such as http://www.usa.gov). Organizations also identify any actions 
            that normally require identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances (e.g., 
            emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypass may be, for 
            example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the login functionality and is 
            protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where 
            identification and authentication have already occurred and are not being repeated, but rather to

        supplementalGuidance: >
            Security attributes are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity 
            (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes are typically 
            associated with internal data structures (e.g., records, buffers, files) within the information system and 
            are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special 
            dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security 
            policy. The term security label is often used to associate a set of security attributes with a specific 
            information object as part of the data structure for that object (e.g., user access privileges, 
            nationality, affiliation as contractor). Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, SC-16, MP-3.

        supplementalGuidance: >
            This control requires explicit authorization prior to allowing remote access to an information system 
            without specifying a specific format for that authorization. For example, while the organization may deem 
            it appropriate to use a system interconnection agreement to authorize a given remote access, such 
            agreements are not required by this control. Remote access is any access to an organizational information 
            system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an external network (e.g., 
            the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless (see AC-18 for 
            wireless access). A virtual private network when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls, 
            is considered an internal network (i.e., the organization establishes a network connection between 
            organization-controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to depend on external 
            networks to protect the confidentiality or integrity of information transmitted across the network). Remote 
            access controls are applicable to information systems other than public web servers or systems specifically 
            designed for public access. Enforcing access restrictions associated with remote connections is 
            accomplished by control AC-3. Related controls: AC-3, AC-18, AC-20, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4.

            AutoPlay.</p>
            <p>Organizational policies and procedures for mobile devices used by individuals departing on and returning

            The purpose of this control is for the organization to identify events which need to be auditable as 
            significant and relevant to the security of the information system; giving an overall system requirement in 
            order to meet ongoing and specific audit needs. To balance auditing requirements with other information 
            system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are to be audited 
            at a given point in time. For example, the organization may determine that the information system must have 
            the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability 
            except for specific circumstances due to the extreme burden on system performance. In addition, audit 
            records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information 
            traverses the network. Selecting the right level of abstraction for audit record generation is a critical 
            aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Related

            organization establishes the security control selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the 
            security controls within the information system and its environment of operation for assessment. Those 
            security controls that are the most volatile (i.e., controls most affected by ongoing changes to the 
            information system or its environment of operation) or deemed critical by the organization to protecting 
            organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation are assessed more 
            frequently in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. All other controls are assessed at 
            least once during the information system's three-year authorization cycle. The organization can use the 
            current year's assessment results from any of the above sources to meet the FISMA annual assessment

            This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems and does not apply to transitory, 
            user-controlled connections such as email and website browsing. The organization carefully considers the 
            risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected to other systems with different 
            security requirements and security controls, both within the organization and external to the organization. 
            Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with each connection and the appropriate controls 
            employed. If the interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, an Interconnection Security 
            Agreement is not required. Rather, the interface characteristics between the interconnecting information 
            systems are described in the security plans for the respective systems. If the interconnecting systems have 
            different authorizing officials but the authorizing officials are in the same organization, the 
            organization determines whether an Interconnection Security Agreement is required, or alternatively, the 
            interface characteristics between systems are described in the security plans of the respective systems. 
            Instead of developing an Interconnection Security Agreement, organizations may choose to incorporate this 
            information into a formal contract, especially if the interconnection is to be established between a 
            federal agency and a nonfederal (private sector) organization. In every case, documenting the interface 
            characteristics is required, yet the formality and approval process vary considerably even though all 
            accomplish the same fundamental objective of managing the risk being incurred by the interconnection of the 
            information systems. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks.

        supplementalGuidance: >
            Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official or 
            executive (i.e., authorizing official) to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly 
            accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation 
            based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. Authorizing officials typically 
            have budgetary oversight for information systems or are responsible for the mission or business operations 
            supported by the systems. Security authorization is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore, 
            authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing 
            officials are accountable for the security risks associated with information system operations. 
            Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of authority commensurate with 
            understanding and accepting such information system-related security risks. Through the employment of a 
            comprehensive continuous monitoring process, the critical information contained in the authorization 
            package (i.e., the security plan (including risk assessment), the security assessment report, and the plan 
            of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing the authorizing official and the 
            information system owner with an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system. To 
            reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, the authorizing official uses the results of 
            the continuous monitoring process to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering a 
            reauthorization decision. OMB policy requires that federal information systems are reauthorized at least 
            every three years or when there is a significant change to the system. The organization defines what 
            constitutes a significant change to the information system. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10.

        supplementalGuidance: >
            A continuous monitoring program allows an organization to maintain the security authorization of an 
            information system over time in a highly dynamic environment of operation with changing threats, 
            vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business processes. Continuous monitoring of security controls 
            using automated support tools facilitates near real-time risk management and promotes organizational 
            situational awareness with regard to the security state of the information system. The implementation of a 
            continuous monitoring program results in ongoing updates to the security plan, the security assessment 
            report, and the plan of action and milestones, the three principal documents in the security authorization 
            package. A rigorous and well executed continuous monitoring program significantly reduces the level of 
            effort required for the reauthorization of the information system. Continuous monitoring activities are 
            scaled in accordance with the impact level of the information system. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6,

            the information system. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Examples of 
            access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), 
            workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes are implemented into a third-party 
            interface rather than directly into the information system component), and change windows (e.g., changes 
            occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes outside the window easy to discover). 
            Some or all of the enforcement mechanisms and processes necessary to implement this security control 
            are included in other controls. For measures implemented in other controls, this control provides 
            information to be used in the implementation of the other controls to cover specific needs related to 
            enforcing authorizations to make changes to the information system, auditing changes, and retaining and 
            review records of changes. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.

            Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of information technology 
            products that are part of the information system. Security-related parameters are those parameters 
            impacting the security state of the system including parameters related to meeting other security 
            control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example, registry settings; account, 
            file, and directory settings (i.e., permissions); and settings for services, ports, protocols, 
            and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide mandatory configuration settings from 
            which the settings for a given information system are derived. A <em>security configuration checklist
            </em> (sometimes referred to as a lockdown guide, hardening guide, security guide, security technical 
            implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark) is a series of instructions or procedures for configuring an 
            information system component to meet operational requirements. Checklists can be developed by 
            information technology developers and vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies (and 
            other government organizations), and others in the public and private sectors. An example of a security 
            configuration checklist is the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) which potentially affects the 
            implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation 
            Protocol (SCAP) and defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) 
            provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB 
            establishes federal policy on configuration requirements for federal information systems.

        supplementalGuidance: >
            Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the 
            functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational 
            operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple 
            services from a single component of an information system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the 
            services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a 
            single function per device (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and services 
            provided by organizational information systems, or individual components of information systems, are 
            carefully reviewed to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice 
            Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, file sharing). Organizations consider disabling 
            unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus [USB], File 
            Transfer Protocol [FTP], Internet Protocol Version 6 [IPv6], Hyper Text Transfer Protocol [HTTP]) on 
            information system components to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of 
            information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion 
            detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion 
            detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and

            Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational program for achieving 
            continuity of operations for mission/business operations. Contingency planning addresses both 
            information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business processes when 
            systems are compromised. Information system recovery objectives are consistent with applicable laws, 
            Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations. In addition to information system 
            availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in 
            mission/business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity 
            of the information system. Examples of actions to call out in contingency plans include, for example, 
            graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to a manual mode, alternate information 
            flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when the system is under attack. Related

            <p>Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have 
            equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers, individuals from allied nations). 
            Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly 
            identified and documented by the organization in AC-14. Unique identification of individuals in group 
            accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) may need to be considered for detailed accountability of 
            activity. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, 
            biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to 
            organizational information systems is defined as either local or network. Local access is any access to an 
            organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is 
            obtained by direct connection without the use of a network. Network access is any access to an 
            organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is 
            obtained through a network connection. Remote access is a type of network access which involves 
            communication through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local area 
            networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks that are under the control of the organization. 
            For a virtual private network (VPN), the VPN is considered an internal network if the organization 
            establishes the VPN connection between organization-controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require 
            the organization to depend on any external networks across which the VPN transits to protect the 
            confidentiality and integrity of information transmitted. Identification and authentication requirements 
            for information system access by other than organizational users are described in IA-8.</p>

            Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with organization-specific implementation plans

            at logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when 
            necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. Related controls: AC-14, AC-17,

            Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for identification or an organizational authentication 
            solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport 
            Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local and/or wide

        supplementalGuidance: >
            User authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. 
            Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements 
            about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). Many information system components are shipped 
            with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. 
            Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, present a significant 
            security risk, and therefore, are changed upon installation. The requirement to protect user authenticators 
            may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of users and by controls 
            AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within the information system (e.g., passwords stored in a 
            hashed or encrypted format, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible only with super user 
            privileges). The information system supports user authenticator management by organization-defined settings 
            and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, 
            password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one time tokens, and number of allowed 
            rejections during verification stage of biometric authentication. Measures to safeguard user authenticators 
            include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing 
            authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator 
            management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such 
            as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and 
            passwords. Related controls: AC-2, IA-2, PL-4, PS-6.

            digital cameras, and audio recording devices) that are transported outside of controlled areas. Telephone 
            systems are also considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on 
            internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the 
            identification, authentication,and access control mechanisms typically employed in other information 
            systems, organizational personnel use caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail 
            systems that are transported outside of controlled areas. A controlled area is any area or space for which 
            the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to 
            meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system.</p>
            <p>Physical and technical security measures for the protection of digital and non-digital media are 
            commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information residing on the media, and 
            consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, 
            and guidance. Locked containers and cryptography are examples of security measures available to protect 
            digital and non-digital media during transport. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and/or 
            integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. An organizational assessment of risk guides: 
            <ol><li>the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring protection 
            during transport; and</li><li>the selection and use of storage containers for transporting non-digital 
            media.</li></ol> Authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside the

            The organization sanitizes information system media, both digital and non-digital, prior to disposal,

        supplementalGuidance: >
            This control applies to all media subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not considered removable. 
            Sanitization is the process used to remove information from information system media such that there is 
            reasonable assurance that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, 
            including clearing, purging, and destroying media information, prevent the disclosure of organizational 
            information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. The 
            organization employs sanitization mechanisms with strength and integrity commensurate with the 
            classification or sensitivity of the information. The organization uses its discretion on the employment of 
            sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain 
            or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if released 
            for reuse or disposal.

        supplementalGuidance: >
            Physical and environmental hazards include, for example, flooding, fire, tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, 
            acts of terrorism, vandalism, electromagnetic pulse, electrical interference, and electromagnetic 
            radiation. Whenever possible, the organization also considers the location or site of the facility with 
            regard to physical and environmental hazards. In addition, the organization considers the location of 
            physical entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be 
            in close proximity to the information system and therefore, increase the potential for unauthorized access 
            to organizational communications (e.g., through the use of wireless sniffers or microphones). This control, 
            to include any enhancements specified, may be satisfied by similar requirements fulfilled by another 
            organizational entity other than the information security program. Organizations avoid duplicating actions 
            already covered.

            <p>A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an effective risk assessment. Risk 
            assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and security controls planned or in place 
            to determine the level of residual risk posed to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
            organizations, and the Nation based on the operation of the information system. Risk assessments also take 
            into account risk posed to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals from external 
            parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization, 
            individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB 
            policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal 
            information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, 
            organizational assessments of risk also address public access to federal information systems. The General 
            Services Administration provides tools supporting that portion of the risk assessment dealing with public 
            access to federal information systems.</p>
            <p>Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted by organizations at various steps in the 
            Risk Management Framework including: information system categorization; security control selection; 
            security control implementation; security control assessment; information system authorization; and 
            security control monitoring. RA-3 is a noteworthy security control in that the control must be partially 
            implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in the 
            Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in the security control selection 
            process during the application of tailoring guidance for security control baselines and when considering 
            supplementing the tailored baselines with additional security controls or control enhancements.</p>

            The security categorization of the information system guides the frequency and comprehensiveness of the 
            vulnerability scans. Vulnerability analysis for custom software and applications may require additional, 
            more specialized techniques and approaches (e.g., web-based application scanners, source code reviews, 
            source code analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for specific functions, ports, 
            protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices and for improperly configured 
            or incorrectly operating information flow mechanisms. The organization considers using tools that express 
            vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open 
            Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to test for the presence of vulnerabilities. The Common Weakness 
            Enumeration (CWE) and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) are also excellent sources for 
            vulnerability information. In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises are 
            another source of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Related controls: CA-2, CM-6, RA-3, SI-2.

            An external information system service is a service that is implemented outside of the authorization 
            boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that is used by, but not a part of, 
            the organizational information system). Relationships with external service providers are established in 
            a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements 
            (i.e., contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or 
            supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for adequately mitigating risks arising from the use of 
            external information system services remains with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials require 
            that an appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the 
            many issues associated with information security. For services external to the organization, a chain of 
            trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating 
            provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the 
            services rendered to the organization. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the 
            relationship between the organization and the external provider. Where a sufficient level of trust 
            cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs 
            compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk. The external information system 
            services documentation includes government, service provider, and end user security roles and 
            responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of 
            performance for each required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and 
            response requirements for any identified instance of noncompliance.

            The organization requires that the information system meets [<em>Assignment: organization-defined level 
            of trustworthiness</em>].
        supplementalGuidance: >
            <p>The intent of this control is to ensure that organizations recognize the importance of trustworthiness 
            and making explicit trustworthiness decisions when designing, developing, and implementing 
            organizational information systems. Trustworthiness is a characteristic or property of an information 
            system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, 
            integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted by the system. 
            Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined 
            levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are 
            expected to occur in the specified environments of operation. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness 
            of an information system include:
            <ol>
            <li><em>security functionality</em> (i.e., the security features or functions employed within the system); 
            and </li>
            <li><em>security assurance</em> (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is 
            effective in its application).</li>
            </ol></p>
            <p>Appropriate security functionality for the information system can be obtained by using the Risk 
            Management Framework (Steps 1, 2, and 3) to select and implement the necessary management, operational, 
            and technical security controls necessary to mitigate risk to organizational operations and assets, 
            individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Appropriate security assurance can be obtained 
            by:
            <ol>
            <li>the actions taken by developers and implementers of security controls with regard to the design, 
            development, implementation, and operation of those controls; and</li>
            <li>the actions taken by assessors to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented 
            correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the 
            security requirements for the information system.</li>
            </ol></p>
            <p>Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security controls by employing well-defined 
            security policy models, structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development 
            techniques, and sound system/security engineering principles. Assurance is also based on the assessment 
            of evidence produced during the initiation, acquisition/development, implementation, and 
            operations/maintenance phases of the system development life cycle. For example, developmental evidence 
            may include the techniques and methods used to design and develop security functionality. Operational 
            evidence may include flaw reporting and remediation, the results of security incident reporting, and the 
            results of the ongoing monitoring of security controls. Independent assessments by qualified assessors 
            may include analyses of the evidence as well as testing, inspections, and audits. Minimum assurance 
            requirements are described in Appendix E.</p>
            <p>Explicit trustworthiness decisions highlight situations where achieving the information system 
            resilience and security capability necessary to withstand cyber attacks from adversaries with certain 
            threat capabilities may require adjusting the risk management strategy, the design of mission/business 
            processes with regard to automation, the selection and implementation rigor of management and operational 
            protections, or the selection of information technology components with higher levels of trustworthiness. 
            Trustworthiness may be defined on a component-by-component, subsystem-by-subsystem, or 
            function-by-function basis. It is noted, however, that typically functions, subsystems, and components 
            are highly interrelated, making separation by trustworthiness perhaps problematic and at a minimum, 
            something that likely requires careful attention in order to achieve practically useful results. Related

            Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions necessary to administer 
            databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. 
            The separation of user functionality from information system management functionality is either physical 
            or logical and is accomplished by using different computers, different central processing units, 
            different instances of the operating system, different network addresses, combinations of these 
            methods, or other methods as appropriate. An example of this type of separation is observed in web 
            administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information 
            system resources. This may include isolating the administrative interface on a different domain and

            A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides name/address 
            resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there are typically 
            at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as 
            secondary. Additionally, the two servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and 
            geographically separated (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). With regard to role 
            separation, DNS servers with an internal role, only process name/address resolution requests from 
            within the organization (i.e., internal clients). DNS servers with an external role only process 
            name/address resolution information requests from clients external to the organization 
            (i.e., on the external networks including the Internet). The set of clients that can access an 
            authoritative DNS server in a particular role is specified by the organization 
            (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists).

            officers). The organization (including any contractor to the organization) promptly installs 
            security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered 
            during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system 
            error handling, are also addressed expeditiously. Organizations are encouraged to use resources such as 
            the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in 
            remediating flaws discovered in organizational information systems. By requiring that flaw remediation

            Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic mail servers, web 
            servers, proxy servers, and remote-access servers. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, 
            Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, 
            Unicode) or contained within a compressed file. Removable media includes, for example, USB devices, 
            diskettes, or compact disks. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the 
            effects of malicious code attacks. Pervasive configuration management and strong software integrity 
            controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial 
            off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, 
            for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational 
            missions and business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms are not built to detect 
            such code. In these situations, organizations must rely instead on other risk mitigation measures to 
            include, for example, secure coding practices, trusted procurement processes, configuration management 
            and control, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than 
            those intended. Related controls: SA-4, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SI-4, SI-7.

            Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes 
            the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary 
            protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system (e.g., 
            within internal organizational networks and system components). Information system monitoring capability 
            is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion 
            prevention systems, malicious code protection software, audit record monitoring software, network 
            monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, at selected 
            perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically 
            being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The Einstein network 
            monitoring device from the Department of Homeland Security is an example of a system monitoring device. 
            The granularity of the information collected is determined by the organization based on its monitoring 
            objectives and the capability of the information system to support such activities. An example of a 
            specific type of transaction of interest to the organization with regard to monitoring is Hyper Text 
            Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses organizational HTTP proxies, when use of such proxies 
            is required. Related controls: AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2, AU-6, SI-3, SI-7.

            While mean time to failure is primarily a reliability issue, this control focuses on the potential 
            failure of specific components of the information system that provide security capability. Mean time to 
            failure rates are defendable and based on considerations that are installation-specific, not 
            industry-average. The transfer of responsibilities between active and standby information system 
            components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security (e.g., state variables are 
            preserved). The standby component is available at all times except where a failure recovery is in 
            progress or for maintenance reasons. Related control: CP-2.

        supplementalGuidance: >
            <p>The information security program plan can be represented in a single document or compilation of 
            documents at the discretion of the organization. The plan documents the organization-wide program 
            management controls and organization-defined common controls. The security plans for individual 
            information systems and the organization-wide information security program plan together, provide 
            complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organization. Common controls are 
            documented in an appendix to the organization's information security program plan unless the controls 
            are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security controls employed as 
            part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one 
            or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan 
            will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls</p>
            <p>Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple 
            documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as 
            attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains 
            multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials 
            responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the 
            respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management 
            Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and 
            environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated with a 
            particular information system but instead, support multiple information systems.

            The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with the Federal Enterprise 
            Architecture. The integration of information security requirements and associated security controls into 
            the organization's enterprise architecture helps to ensure that security considerations are addressed by 
            organizations early in the system development life cycle and are directly and explicitly related to the 
            organization's mission/business processes. This also embeds into the enterprise architecture, an 
            integral security architecture consistent with organizational risk management and information security 
            strategies. Security requirements and control integration are most effectively accomplished through the 
            application of the Risk Management Framework and supporting security standards and guidelines. The
